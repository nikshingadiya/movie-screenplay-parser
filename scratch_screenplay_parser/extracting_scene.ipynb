CITY - NIGHTA SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing --JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair.  At 22, his eyes are hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured pain beyond his years.Jake stares upward at the levels of the city.  MAGLEV TRAINS WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish advertizing. JAKE (V.O.)They can fix a spinal, if you’ve got the money.  But not on vet benefits, not in this economy.The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair.  Most of the people wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air.  In a LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous, isolated souls.INT. JAKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHTThe room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom.  Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. --PERKY NEWSCASTERThe Bengal tiger, extinct for over a century, is making a comeback.  These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are...Jake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side, pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the other, and so on.His legs are white and atrophied.  Utterly useless.  But his arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled.  A “Born Loser” tattoo prominent on his shoulder.JAKE (V.O.)I became a Marine for the hardship.  To be hammered on the anvil of life.  I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass.Jake struggles with his pants a long time.CUT TO:INT. ROWDY BAR -- NIGHT Not the kind of place you’d bring your mom.We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his forehead.  ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets, CLAP and WHOOP.Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer.  A WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men RUNNING on antelope legs.CU JAKE, watching what he can’t have.  Expression stony.JAKE (V.O.)Let’s get it straight up front.  I don’t want your pity.  I know the world’s a cold-ass bitch.Jake’s eyes shift -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in the crowd.  A MAN on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he’s with.  Hard.  She cowers but he’s got her arm, shouting, raising his fist.  An eternal tableau.  People look away.CU JAKE -- not looking away.JAKE (V.O.)You want a fair deal, you’re on the wrong planet.  The strong prey on the weak.  TIGHT ON JAKE’S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his chair.TRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward.                                     2.JAKE (V.O.)It’s just the way things are.  And nobody does a damn thing.Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man.  He leans down and grabs one leg of the man’s barstool -- and YANKS.The chair flips.  The guy goes down HARD and --JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy, getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap out of him, right there on the floor.THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling...JAKE (V.O.)All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.CUT TO:EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR -- NIGHTTHE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on the pavement.  A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him, banging across the alley, landing in the trash.Jake struggles to rise on one elbow.  He’s bleeding and bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.JAKEI hope you realize you’ve just lost a customer!He collapses onto his back, panting.JAKE(to himself)Candy ass bitch.He stares upwards at the levels of the city.  MAGTRAINS ROAR overhead.  It starts to RAIN.  He just lies there, blinking -- then shouts jauntily to no one in particular --JAKEIf it ain’t rainin’ we ain’t trainin’!CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled amongst the trash, getting drenched.TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him.                                     3.Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him.  He squints up at --TWO MEN.  Matching suits.  Their features unremarkable and blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors.  AGENT 1Are you Jake Sully?JAKEStep off.  You’re ruinin’ my good mood.AGENT 2It’s about your brother.CUT TO:INT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHTDOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box.  HANDS ENTER FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN’S FACE. He looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake.  His IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY.  JAKE (V.O.)The strong prey on the weak.  A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet.WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech CREMATORIUM -- a row of stainless steel furnaces.  Jake stares down at his own face.JAKEJesus, Tommy.JAKE (V.O.)The Suits’ concern was touching.AGENT 1Your brother represented a significant investment.  We’d like to talk to you about taking over his contract. The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape dispenser, like it’s a package for shipping.  The cardboard coffin is rolled into the furnace.JAKE (V.O.)The egghead and the jarhead.   Tommy was the scientist, not me.  He was the one who wanted to get shot light years out into space to find the answers.                                       4.PUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light.JAKE (V.O.)Me -- I was just another dumb grunt gettin’ sent someplace I was gonna regret.INSIDE THE FURNACE the burners quickly eat away the cardboard;  TOMMY’S FACE is, for a moment, wreathed in flame but not touched by it, as we -- DISSOLVE TO:JAKE’S FACE, in icy darkness.  CLOSE ON his eyes -- they OPEN suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath.   JAKE’S POV -- the inside of a metal coffin.  A SERVO WHINE and we are moving, emerging into a large chamber --INT. CRYO VAULT JAKE’S POV -- A TECH in medical scrubs FLOATS WEIGHTLESSLY toward us.  Wherever we are, we’re not on Earth.Jake squints as the lights flicker on, revealing --WIDE SHOT -- the multi-tiered CRYO VAULT.  Hundreds of CRYO-CAPSULES are opening like morgue drawers, as med techs pull themselves about in ZERO-G, tending to their patients.  JAKE(a hoarse whisper)Are we there?MED TECHWe’re there, Sunshine.TIME CUT -- SCORES OF PEOPLE emerge from their cryo-capsules in ZERO-G.  Pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open coffins.The MED TECH floats among them, using his announcement voice. MED TECHPeople, you have been in cryo for five years, nine months and twenty two days.  You will be hungry, you will be weak. If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience.  The staff thanks you in advance.                                     5.FOLLOWING JAKE as he pushes away from his capsule, gliding to the LOCKERS across the aisle, his paralyzed legs not an impediment in weightlessness.CUT TO:EXT. SPACEAgainst the cold infinity of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE STAR.  As it moves past like an endless train, we realize this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half a mile long.  PAN WITH IT 180 to REVEAL --A GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face.The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a blue and surprisingly Earth-like world called PANDORA. The ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON.CUT TO:EXT. PANDORA ORBITISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora. CLOSE ON ISV -- two massive “VALKYRIE” SHUTTLES are mated to a DOCKING NODE.  One of them separates from the starship and moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts.As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we--CUT TO:EXT. RAINFOREST - TWILIGHTFLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas carpeted in rainforest.  Great scarves of cloud swirl around the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding. The trees are alien, the color too cyan.  There are waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES.Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to --AN OPEN-PIT MINE.  A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie-cutter took a chunk out of the world.  Down among the terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story buildings.And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY --                                     6.EXT. HELL’S GATE - TWILIGHTHELL’S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high, topped with razor wire.  At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS swiveling on servo mounts.  Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in across the treetops.  VECTORING NOZZLES change angle, bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER.EXT. RAIN FOREST - TWILIGHTThrough a screen of jungle canopy, we see the VALKYRIE thunder overhead.  Camera TILTS with it until leaves block the view.A BLUE INHUMAN HAND reaches INTO SHOT, parting the foliage to reveal the shuttle hover-taxiing across the compound.REVERSE -- ECU of two intense, cat-like golden EYES watching.INT./EXT. SHUTTLE The CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling --CREW CHIEFExopacks on!Passengers don their EXO-PACK breathing gear with practiced moves.  Everybody except JAKE, who’s turning his this way and that trying to figure out the straps.  CREW CHIEFRemember people, you lose your mask you’re unconscious in 20 seconds and you’re dead in four minutes. Let’s nobody be dead today, it looks bad on my report. The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark --CREW CHIEFExopack on, let’s go! BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter radius as it settles onto its landing gear.  INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles ready.  Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks -- and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the level of everyone else’s WAISTS.                                     7.THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine.CREW CHIEFGo directly into the base! Do not stop!  Go straight inside!HAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex.  Inside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops is the colony’s private security force.  These guys are laid back, hardened, and haggard.  WAINFLEETLook at all that new meat.THEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp. FIKECheck it out, man.  Meals on wheels.WAINFLEETThat is just wrong. Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as --A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy wheels.  He notices something sticking in the tires -- ARROWS.  The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the advanced technology. Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off.  Armored and heavily armed, they are AT-99 “SCORPION” GUNSHIPS. MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4 meters tall -- patrol the perimeter.  They are heavily armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds of feet high.   A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS light up the twilight.  A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off the fence.  It is an armed camp in a state of siege.  WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball as he approaches.JAKEWhat’re you two limpdicks starin’ at?As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and --                                     8.K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his head. A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs against the steel.  It STABS at him through the chain link with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto.  A STINGBAT.WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.  It drops off the fence, tail still lashing.WAINFLEETSeen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair.  Never seen anybody show up in one.Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien.ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair through the tunnel below.The hair is clipped short.  The scalp is etched by long parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen’s claws raked across it.  The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars.The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.  He eyes are an icy steel gray.HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky, beyond the clouds.MAN (V.O.)You are not in Kansas any more...CUT TO:INT. COMMISSARY - TWILIGHTTHE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell’s Gate colony.  A hundred new arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the front of the large cafeteria.  He stops, stance wide.Without his mask, we see that Quaritch’s features are rugged and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to jaw down one side of his face.  On one hip he carries a very large PISTOL.QUARITCH... You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen. Respect that fact every second of every day.                                      9.JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back.COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window, toward the dark treeline.QUARITCHOut beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubees. The room gets very quiet.QUARITCHWe have an indigenous population of humanoids here called the Na’vi.  They’re fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute.  We operate -- we live -- at a constant threat condition yellow.PAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Cat-machine drivers, engineers, geologists, as they take that in.QUARITCHAs head of security, it’s my job to keep you alive.   I will not succeed -- (pausing for effect)-- not with all of you. If you wish to survive, you need a strong mental attitude, you need to follow procedure...PUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues.JAKE (V.O.)Nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease.CUT TO:INT. CORRIDORPeople are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms, lugging duffels and cases.An eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake.NORMHey, you’re Jake right?  Tom’s brother? You look just like him.(off Jake’s wary look)Sorry, I’m Norm Spellman, I went through avatar training with him.                                     10.Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it.NORMHe was a great guy -- funny.  It was a big shock to all of us.JAKEYeah. Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on.  Norm walks with him.NORMAnd duh! -- obviously you look like him.  I mean, if you weren’t genetically identical, you wouldn’t be taking over his avatar.JAKEThat’s why I’m here.NORMSo -- you want to go check it out?CUT TO:INT. BIO-LAB - DAYJAKE AND NORM enter the BIO-LAB -- a large lab complex with many adjoining rooms.MAXMe and Norm were out here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars.  They’re grown from human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives here.A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS.  The nearer has the sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK.Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by some unseen force, toward --THE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside, which looks like a man.  A very large, very blue, man.Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the abdomen.  As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see that it has a lemur-like TAIL.  The skin is cyan-blue.  Long black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed.JAKEDamn.  They got big.                                     11.NORMYeah, they mature on the trip out.(to Max)So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty well. MAXYeah, they’ve got great muscle tone. Give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin.THE FIGURE’S sleeping face turns toward us, and the features are -- despite feline ears and a long feral snout -- definitely JAKE’S.JAKEIt looks like him.NORMNo, it looks like you.  This is your avatar now, Jake.ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank.JAKE (V.O.)The idea is -- every driver is matched to his own avatar --STEREOCAM VIDEO SHOT OF JAKE -- facing the camera, talking directly to the lens.  JAKE’S VOICE-OVER up until now has been part of this VIDEOLOG.JAKE-- so their nervous systems are in tune.  Or something.  Which is why they offered me this gig, because I can link with Tommy’s avatar, which was insanely expensive.(looking off camera)Is this right?  I just say whatever in these videologs?WIDER, showing Norm working nearby with Max.NORMYeah. You just need to get in the habit of documenting everything -- what you see, what you feel -- it’s all part of the science.  Good science starts with good observation.                                     12.JAKERight.(to camera)So, whatever.  Here I am.  Doing science.  (looks around)Never been in a lab before.MAXLog off.  It’s time to meet your boss for the next five years.He leads Jake and Norm through the short corridor to the --CUT TO:INT. LINK ROOM - DUSKThe LINK ROOM contains a dozen PSIONIC LINK UNITS, which look like coffins crossed with MRI scanners.NORMGrace Augustine is a legend.  She's the head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote the book -- I mean literally wrote the book -- on Pandoran botany.MAX(low, over his shoulder)That's because she likes plants better than people.DR. GRACE AUGUSTINE sits up in her link, stretching and cracking her neck after a long session.  She’s fifty, with a strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes.GRACE(yelling)Who’s got my goddamn cigarette?!A TECH scurries to bring it to her, already lit.  Around here they jump when Grace barks.Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach.MAXAnd here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.  Grace, I’d like you to meet Norm Spellman and Ja --GRACENorm.  I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?                                     13.NORM(Na'vi, subtitled)May the All Mother smile upon our first meeting.Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette.GRACE(subtitled)Not bad.  You sound a little formal.NORM(subtitled)There is still much to learn.Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na’vi.MAXUh, Grace, this is Jake S----GRACE(turning to Jake)Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I don’t need you.  I need your brother.(to Max)You know -- the PhD who trained three years for this mission.JAKEHe’s dead.  I know it’s a big inconvenience to everyone.GRACEHow much lab training have you had?  Ever run a gas chromatograph?JAKENo.GRACEAny actual lab work at all?JAKEHigh school chemistry.  But I ditched.Grace wheels on Max.GRACEYou see?  You see?  They’re pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain.(turning away)I’m going to Selfridge.                                     14.She shoves past Jake.MAXGrace, that’s not a good idea.But she’s already out the door and clomping down the corridor.  Max turns to Jake with a pained look.MAXHere, tomorrow, oh eight hundred.  Try to use big words.CUT TO:INT. OPS CENTER - DUSKIt looks like an air-traffic control tower, with lots of screens and bay windows showing the whole complex.ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor.  Selfridge is young, charismatic, focused.  Some would say ruthless.He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a practice cup across the control room floor.  He glances up as Grace strides toward him.GRACE Parker, I used to think it was benign neglect, but now I see you’re intentionally screwing us.SELFRIDGEGrace.  You know I enjoy our little talks.GRACEI need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout.Selfridge looks down and hits the ball.Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past. Selfridge looks at her with a sigh.SELFRIDGEActually, we got lucky with him.GRACELucky?  How is this in any way lucky?As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball --                                     15.SELFRIDGEWell -- lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky the brother wasn’t an oral hygienist or something.  A Marine we can use. I’m assigning him to your team as security escort.GRACEThe last thing I need is another trigger happy asshole out there!SELFRIDGELook, you’re supposed to be winning the hearts and minds of the natives.  Isn’t that the whole point of your little puppet show?  If you look like them, if you talk like them, they’ll trust you?Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby.  Grace follows.SELFRIDGEBut after -- how many years? -- relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.GRACEThat tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.On Selfridge’s desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid-air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK.  Pure UNOBTANIUM.  He grabs it and holds it up between thumb and forefinger, in front of Grace’s eyes.SELFRIDGEThis is why we’re here. Unobtanium. Because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo.  No other reason.  This is what pays for the party.  And it’s what pays for your science.  Comprendo?He places it back in the magnetic field.SELFRIDGEThose savages are threatening our whole operation.  We’re on the brink of war and you’re supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.  So use what you’ve got and get me some results.CUT TO:                                     16.INT. LINK ROOM - DAYNEXT MORNING, GRACE, NORM and JAKE approach their link units.Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW.  In an adjoining chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE’S AVATAR lies on a gurney, breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR.  NORM’S AVATAR is on a second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks.Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric sensors.GRACEHow much link time have you logged?NORMFive hundred and twenty hours.Grace looks pointedly at Jake.JAKELike -- an hour.GRACETell me you’re joking.Grace opens the hood of Jake’s link unit.  Jake starts hauling himself across from his wheelchair.  She reaches to help him but --JAKEDon’t!  I got this.Grace steps back, hands raised.  He drags himself into the unit.GRACESo you just figured you’d come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went?  What was going through your head?He meets her eyes with a defiant glare.JAKEMaybe I was just tired of doctors telling me what I couldn’t do.Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the link chair by hand.                                     17.Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit. It seems to enfold him.  Grace adjusts his biometric sensors, then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL --GRACERelax and let your mind go blank.

Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.JAKEWait, don’t --                                     38.Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still see.  In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest is transformed.The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.  Jake scrambles to recover his spear.  Neytiri kneels beside --A DYING WOLF.  It’s CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air, trying to raise its head.  She pulls her KNIFE from its chest.NEYTIRI(in Na’vi)Forgive me, my brother. She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches its head gently, regarding it with sadness.Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her waist.  She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling the arrow from its heart.  JAKELook, um, I know you probably don’t understand this.  But -- thanks. Thank you.  I owe you.Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal.NEYTIRI(in Na’vi)Forgive me.

She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.  He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.NEYTIRIDon’t thank!  You don’t thank for this! This is sad. Very sad, only.JAKEOkay, I’m sorry.  Whatever I did -- I’m sorry.She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves.NEYTIRIAll this is your fault! They did not need to die.JAKEThey attacked me.

Jake turns to bolt, but --NA’VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed -- blocking his retreat. Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the LEAD RIDER.

NEYTIRIWhen you are ready.The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.NEYTIRIHeeyaaahh!Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee DROPS off the branch.  It swoops down across the forest canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a power climb.Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.  ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount, the rainforest rolling beneath her.CUT TO:INT. SHACK - NIGHT/EXTSTEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the camera.  He looks tired.JAKEDo I have to do this?  I need some rack.GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling.GRACE No -- now, when it’s fresh. JAKEYeah, yeah.  (to camera)The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it’s like field-stripping a weapon.  Repetition.  THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri touches her lips with her fingertips.                                     61.JAKESeyri.She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence. JAKEOntu, mikyun, nari.NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he draws a longbow.BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the elbow, repositioning him roughly.JAKE (V.O.)Neytiri thinks I’m some kind of retard.  HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm’s bunk. Norm blushes and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.JAKE (V.O.)Norm’s attitude has improved lately. NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen. NORMThank you?  JAKEIreiyo.Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.NORMIrrrreiyo.  Irrrreiyo.  You’ve gotta roll the R, r-r-r-oll it.Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.JAKE (V.O.)It’s good he’s back on board, but he thinks I’m a retard too.TRACKING WITH JAKE’S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto a thick root, running on across the rough bark.JAKE (V.O.)My feet are getting tougher.  I can run farther every day.                                      62.Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are running 30 meters above the ground.  He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.  She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.JAKE (V.O.)I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri it’s learn fast or die.Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its DROOP to slow her fall.  She lets go, plummeting, and catches another. JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith.  THE CAMERA PLUNGES with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush.He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a game trail.  He is exhilarated to still be alive. Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.  That he lived.TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack.  Thinking as he looks at the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO’AT.  The  Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.  Grace’s eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na’vi.   JAKE (V.O.)I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass.  Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning.Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching.  It is an awkward moment between them.  Grace makes the formal gesture of greeting.GRACE(Na’vi, subtitled)I See you, Neytiri Mo’at’ite.NEYTIRII See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out the tracks in the mud to Jake.  She touches the edges of the plants around her, and sniffs the air.                                     63.JAKE (V.O.)I’m learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds.JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes flight, an explosion of purple wings. Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her ears, which move with a life of their own.  Her eyes are closed.  She speaks very softly to Jake --NEYTIRIWhen you hear nothing, you will hear everything.  When you see nothing, you will See everything.JAKE (V.O.)Sometimes I have no idea what she’s talking about. Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male HEXAPEDE --  a six legged deer-like creature.Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri watches.  He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm.  Zen archery.JAKE (V.O.)It’s been a month and I’m still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasn’t given permission.OMIITEDNEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.  She points and he parts some leaves to see --A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk around her legs.  She licks their faces.JAKE (V.O.)There’s a lot of crap like that. She’s always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not --                                      64.VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.  He’s changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow.  Pale. JAKE(smirking)I just hope this treehugger shit isn’t on the final.Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples.  GRACE(without looking up)This isn’t just about eye-hand coordination out there.  You need to listen to what she says.  Try to see the forest through their eyes.JAKEExcuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay?NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence.  They move gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.  NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom of a pool.  A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.  ZAP!  Jake drills it.  He holds up the fish, triumphantly.ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders. Aware of her touch, Jake’s focus is broken.  Their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly.NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.  Neytiri signals him to move slowly.  They approach a creature on one of the ferns.  An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING perched on a frond.  As he approaches --SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee. THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.                                      65.Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY.  An EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.  Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until they are all flying.  And for the first time, she is unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake’s eyes open in the darkness.  He doesn’t know where he is.  He weakly pushes open the lid, blinking at the light.JAKE (V.O.)Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes focused in intense concentration.  A beat -- the arrow flies.JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede. He dispatches it with his knife.He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na’vi.JAKE(Na’vi)I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People. NEYTIRI watches with approval.  NEYTIRIA clean kill.  You are ready.CUT TO:INT. SHACK - NIGHTLying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin.  Norm helps Grace get him to his chair.GRACEYou’re still losing weight.  Here -- She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien food.  Bites into it without enthusiasm.JAKEI made a kill today.  We ate it.  I know where that meal came from.                                     66.GRACE Other body.  You need to take care of this body.JAKEYeah yeah.GRACEJake, I’m serious -- you look like crap. You’re burning too hard. Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out.JAKEGet rid of this shit, then you can lecture me.GRACEI’m telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time.JAKENot now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya. GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee.GRACEYeah -- you’re gonna go ride a banshee.  Or die trying.  JAKEThat’s right, Grace. This is what I’ve been working for.GRACEAnd this is your check up from the neck up, Marine.  You’re getting in way too deep. (she turns away)Trust me, I learned the hard way.Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace’s workstation.JAKEWhat did happen at the school?GRACE looks up from making coffee.  Her eyes track across the pictures of the laughing children.  Finally --                                      67.GRACENeytiri’s sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped coming to school.  She was angry about the clear-cutting.GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste. GRACEOne day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up -- they’d set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess they thought I could protect them. GRACE’S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator.GRACEThe troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse. MACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING. GRACEThey killed Sylwanin in the doorway.  Right in front of Neytiri.  Then shot the others.(mildly)I got most of the kids out, before they shot me.JAKEJesus. GRACEYeah. Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it.GRACEA scientist stays objective -- we can not be ruled by emotion.  But I poured ten years of my life into that school. They called me sa’atenuk. Mother. (turning to him)That kind of pain reaches back through the link.  GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake. GRACEIt’s a job.  Learn what you can -- but don’t get attached.                                     68.GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes.GRACEIt’s not our world, Jake.  And we can’t stop what’s coming.  CUT TO:EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAYTSU’TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who’s riding well enough to keep up. The horses’ hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a misty canyon.  JAKE (V.O.)Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven.  It’s the test every young hunter has to pass.TSU’TEY signals a stop.UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation.  Thick vine-like trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in their gnarled grip.   A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the twisted vine-trunks.  This is some sort of freak natural occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the clouds.There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and the ground SHAKES.  Jake looks around at --One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa.  A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is drifting toward them, filling half the sky.The Hunters dismount. JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds.

BEANSTALK - DAY200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along the vine-trunks.  They clamber over one of the unobtanium BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it -- it floats upward.They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them, the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms.  Spray from one of the waterfalls hits them.Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.  Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling over nothingness.  They climb toward the floating islands above. EXT.

She dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven HOOD.  It waits, docile, as --She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu’tey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE.  And Jake sees --The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out-croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.                                     70.TSU’TEYJakesully will go first. Tsu’tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.  Tsu’tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge.NEYTIRI(whispering)Now you choose your ikran.  This you must feel -- inside. If he also chooses you, move quick, like I showed. You will have one chance.JAKEHow will I know if he chooses me?NEYTIRIHe will try to kill you.JAKEOutstanding.Out of sight of Tsu’tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it.  Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didn’t happen.  He is on his own, on the ledge with --The BANSHEES.  They eye him as he approaches.  Several SHRIEK and take flight.  Others flap their wings and yawn, showing rows of fangs, in a threat display.

You cannot wait.Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power.  He grips a hank of the beast’s main, and --JAKEHeeeyyyaaaah!THWAP!  THWAP!  The banshee is off like a shot.  Jake SCREAMS as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and --                                     72.They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is almost tossed lose.

Jake cocks his head, only thinking “bank left” and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath.NEYTIRI’S BANSHEE falls into formation with him.  She signals “follow me” and DIVES.Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her.  Neytiri’s banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while Jake’s wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE around the flank of Mons Veritatis.  The scenery is stunning.  They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines.Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the cliffs.  They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight.Jake is getting the hang of it.  He jinks left, then right, then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal’s back.

Our blue friends all packed up yet? Selfridge swings his DRIVER with good form.SELFRIDGESee, I keep hooking it.  It’s the damn pack.THE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads 220. A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it.SELFRIDGEThe low gravity and the high air density cancel out so --JAKEYou called us back to report -- you want to hear it or not? SELFRIDGEGo ahead.GRACEJake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months.  But -- we need more time.                                      80.SELFRIDGENot what I was hoping to hear.It starts to rain.  Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from his golf bag and snaps it open.GRACEParker, it’s their ancestral home. They’ve lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few more weeks.SELFRIDGEThis thing is inevitable.  What does it matter when it happens? I’m sorry, Dr. Augustine.  You’re out of time.He leaves them standing there to get drenched.CUT TO:INT. ARMOR BAY A break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake. He studies Jake’s pale, sunken face.  The scraggly beard.QUARITCHYou’re not gettin’ lost in the woods, are you son?Jake can’t meet his eyes.  QUARITCHYour last report was two weeks ago. I’m starting to doubt your resolve. From what I see, it’s time to terminate this mission. Jake eyes flare with alarm.JAKENo.  I can do this. QUARITCHLook, you’ve given me plenty of usable intel. Like this “Well of Souls” place -- I’ve got them by the balls with that, when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it will.Jake feels hollow inside, knowing what he’s done.                                     81.QUARITCHSo you’ll get your legs back, like I promised.  (puts his hand on Jake’s shoulder)It’s time to come in.Jake ponders this. Isn’t this what he was doing all this for?JAKEI’ve gotta finish this thing.  There’s one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It’s the final stage of becoming a man. Then I’m one of them.  They’ll trust what I say...It’s hard for him to even form these words --JAKE... and I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.QUARITCHThen you need to get it done, Corporal.  CUT TO:EXT. HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS - NIGHTStrange horizontal LIGHTNING branches through the floating mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields. The sky is black and heavy with clouds.INT. SHACK KITCHEN - NIGHTJake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking pretty STRUNG OUT. GRACE is smoking furiously. GRACEJake, I can’t allow this.  You’re just not strong enough. JAKEIt’s the last door -- I’m going through it.  You can help me or get out of the way.Jake pushes past her toward the corridor -- GRACE(grabbing him)Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na’vi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death.                                       82.\\n(MORE)And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm-- we have no idea what that’ll do in an avatar brain. Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor.GRACE follows JAKE as he crosses to the Link. A sheet of LIGHTNING flashes across the sky outside.Norm is initializing the Link.NORMCalibrating.  Thirty seconds.She puts her hands on his shoulders.GRACENo matter what you prove out there-- you are still in here. (shaking him)Right here.JAKEI have to go all the way -- become one of them-- GRACE(furiously)Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of them! Norm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE’ voice.  GRACEOur life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain.  You visit -- and you leave.During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside. GRACE(softening)You can never truly be with her.Jake stops, pinioned by the truth.  He seems suddenly very lost.JAKEYou know why I’m here? Because Quaritch sent me.NORMWhat?                                     83.GRACE (cont'd)JAKEThat’s right -- to embed with the Omaticaya.  To find out how to screw them out of their home.  By deceit or by force, he didn’t care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it.Norm is in shock.  But Grace is eerily calm.GRACEAnd what about now, Jake?JAKEI’m not that guy any more.  Grace nods.  She’s been on his journey every step of the way.GRACEI know.JAKEBut if I tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me out -- I never see her again. And if I tell her the truth, the clan throws me out -- that’s if they don’t cut my heart out and show it to me.Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them.  In his own perfect Hell.NORMThey won’t understand what you’ve done.JAKEThey don’t even have a word for “lie” -- they had to learn it from us.Grace sees he is on the verge of tears.  Lost and alone, between worlds.GRACEI know. I taught it to them.JAKE(pleading)Grace. I’ve gotta go.  They’re waiting.NORMLink is ready.Grace stops him as he tries to close the lid.                                     84.GRACEJake.  You can’t carry this burden much longer.JAKE(smiling wanly)It’s okay. Mo’at says an alien mind probably can’t survive the Dream Hunt anyway. Grace closes the lid.  It feels like closing a coffin. She watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar, somewhere out in the night.GRACE(to Norm)Prep my link.  I’m going in.CUT TO:INT.

GRACE stands with the crowd at the ramp to HOMETREE’S LOWEST LEVEL. Jake barely sees her as he goes down the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter.BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM.TIME CUT -- MO’AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs, CHANTING in a low monotone.  Jake, squatting, washes the smoke over himself with his palms.MACRO - MO’AT’S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with holes.  She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and draws it out of the wood.MO'AT(subtitled)Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree -- bless this worthy Hunter with a true vision.                                     85.MO’AT places the worm on Jake’s out-stretched TONGUE. It twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She indicates he should chew.  He does.MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened.  EYTUKAN removes a writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a scorpion.He places it against the back of Jake’s neck and presses. The insect drives its stinger into Jake’s skin and --Jake grimaces.  Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake alone in the circle.Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant.SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake.  His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening.  Jake looks down at the palms of his hands.

He feels the wind of time blowing through him as --REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while --INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora -- --but the forest is BLASTED.  Fires flicker among trees that are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight. A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow.  Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and --PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK which seems to echo to eternity and --SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body. He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room.MO'ATIt is finished. Neytiri’s face is flooded with relief.  The faces of the clan elders look at Jake expectantly. EYTUKAN(subtitled)Did your Spirit Animal come?Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu’tey and the elders. How can he tell them what he has seen? Mo’at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to peer into his troubled soul.  MO'AT(to Jake)Something has come. (to the others, subtitled)It will take time for the meaning to be clear.She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He gets up, weakly.                                     87.OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE --  Eytukan emerges with Jake and the others.  The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem, which seems to stare down at him. GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed.Eytukan places both hands on Jake’s chest and holds them there. EYTUKAN(subtitled)You are now a son of the Omaticaya.  You are part of the People. All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around and putting their hands on Jake’s shoulders, back, chest -- hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone.DISSOLVE TO:EXT.

POLYPHEMUS RISES behind the trees.NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water.  Jake follows her and --UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES.

It is an exquisitely beautiful spot. The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her.                                     88.NEYTIRIThis is a place for prayers to be heard. And sometimes answered.Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers, his palms, his forearms.  His eyes go wide.  We hear the WHISPERING of ancient Na’vi VOICES.JAKEIt’s like -- a sound you feel.NEYTIRIWe call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa.   A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their shoulders and arms. They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense, almost luminous.  He feels drawn into them.But she pulls back a little.NEYTIRIYou are Omaticaya now.  You may make your own bow from the wood of Hometree.

She rubs her cheek against his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other. Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling. NEYTIRIKissing is very good. But we have something better.She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other on the faintly glowing moss.Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it.  Jake does the same, with trembling anticipation.  The tendrils at the ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined.MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle undulations. JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers. The ultimate intimacy.They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of moss, and ripples of light spread out around them.THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO --LATER.

TROOPERDragon is down.  It’s off the board.SELFRIDGEWhat do you mean, off the board?!Selfridge is stunned.  Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes them all look up.OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH-CUTTER.  Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever forward --SELFRIDGEOh shit.Selfridge DIVES as --K-RASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASH-CUTTER tear through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms go off.  The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of glass and shredded debris.The slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE through the gaping hole into the Ops Center --The TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down at them.  The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are holding the Ops Center.Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask.  In shock.  How could this be happening?CUT TO:EXT. LAKETHE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face bloody, his eyes burning.He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest.                                     144.QUARITCH’S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle.  He sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK.INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link.  Through a window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing.QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to the firing button--WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon.  It misses Neytiri by inches.  He grapples with the THANATOR as its razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.THE TITANS twist and struggle.  QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long burst from the cannon.  Rounds tear into the creature, which SHRIEKS but --NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the ‘suit’s hand but --Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost crushing Neytiri.  CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the ‘suit’s KNIFE and --QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator’s chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing.  QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN.  The thanator slumps, pinning Neytiri's legs under its great bulk.  She is trapped.Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant.JAKE (O.S.)It’s all over Quaritch --  Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The ‘suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun.QUARITCHNothing’s over while I’m breathing.JAKEKinda hoped you’d say that.QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the broken CANNON as --                                      145.Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries, blocking it with the cannon.  He CLOSES faster than the suit can move and --K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy, crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with the huge knife.  Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and --SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away. Jake rolls just before --THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and --JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks. Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but --INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks. The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating. Jake’s link sits just inside.  INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air. Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask.  Bends to pick up his KNIFE.NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator.QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake. QUARITCHHow does it feel to betray your own race?Then, inexplicably, he TURNS.  Walks away.FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us and --CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window.  He is reaching inside for the Link when --JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and --                                      146.JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch’s shoulder and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge of the cockpit but --QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake slams to the ground.INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK.NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull her other leg out.THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and --JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as --QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as --THE KNIFE reaches his throat as -- THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch’s chest.  He looks up.NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released.  A classic archer figure, she NOCKS another arrow.  Then draws and releases smoothly.TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.  QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest.  He touches the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic laugh -- he dies.NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing Quaritch, she lowers her father’s bow.JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and --INT. SHACKHUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor where he gags for breath.  With his last strength, he claws toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room.He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness.NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the debris like a cat.  She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake’s side -- puts the mask over his face and --                                     147.JAKE drags in breath after breath.  He looks up at Neytiri, studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for the first time.Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue of her skin.  There eyes meet across the glass of the mask -- together, separate.  Worldless.CUT TO:EXT. RAINFOREST - DAYMO’AT tends to the mortally wounded TSU’TEY as AVATAR JAKE arrives with Neytiri.

Through a haze of pain, he recognizes Jake.TSU’TEY(Na’vi)I See you, Jakesully.JAKEI See you, Tsu’tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.TSU’TEYAre the people safe?JAKEThey’re safe.Tsu’tey weakly clutches his severed queue.TSU’TEYI can never ride again, or bond with my woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa.

Jake draws his knife.TSU’TEY’S POV -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun.     HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu’tey.  JAKE(Na’vi)Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the Mother Spirit.By his movement, we know that he has ended Tsu’tey’s pain.

HELL’S GATE -DAYNa’vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell’s Gate. Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats flutter about, unimpeded.  The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and the GATES are open to the forest.JAKE (V.O.)A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen. Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold AR’s as the personnel of Hell’s Gate file up the cargo ramp of the remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry, like POW’s. JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of the Sky People.  PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp.  His eyes -- the eyes of a lost soul -- meet JAKE’S.

black claws SLASH past his face amid turbulent bubbles A WATERFALL ahead Jake is swept over the falls with the thanator SWIPING at him from a rock just MISSING and Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract.EXT RIVER BELOW FALLS DAYThe water boils below the cataract Jake’s head bursts through the surface and he gasps for breath.He is carried along by the current but manages to grab a limb on a fallen tree He weakly pulls himself up and just lies there gasping on the trunk.Above him on the cliff the THANATOR BELLOWS a roar which echoes across the jungle.CUT TO:EXT RAINFOREST DAYJAKE wet and bruised crouches under a screen of giant leaves He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with his knife forming a crude but sharp tip.EXT RAINFOREST DAYTRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like it’s a minefield carrying his SPEAR white-knuckled He is freaked and hyper-alert 34.The trees here are a hundred meters high blocking out the sky A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the cyan gloom.POV FROM ABOVE looking down through leaves we watch Jake move warily through the forest ECU TWO GOLDEN EYES bright in the shadows DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb Invisible to him draped on the limb like a leopard is a striking NA’VI GIRL She watches only her eyes moving She is lithe as a cat with a long neck muscular shoulders and nubile breasts And she is devastatingly beautiful for a girl with a tail In human age she would be 18 Her name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her oblivious.NEYTIRI rises soundlessly In one fluid sinuous movement she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS aiming RIGHT AT JAKE Utterly silent.Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his THROAT.ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow muscles tensing for the shot and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her F.G She hesitates.RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow where a single WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a dandelion seed but larger the WOODSPRITE waves its silky CILIA feather light as it balances on the deadly point It glows faintly in the dark shadows.NEYTIRI frowns puzzled and LOWERS her bow slowly The woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom.CUT TO:INT./EXT SAMSON SUNSETGRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY banks in a search pattern.TRUDY (INTERCOM)I’m going to have to call it guys We’re not allowed to run night ops Colonel’s orders 35.Grace looks to the west The sun setting behind alien trees.GRACEShit TRUDYSorry Doc He’s just gonna have to hang on ‘till morning.GRACEHe’s not going to make it till morning.Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard thundering away toward the setting sun.CUT TO:EXT RAINFOREST NIGHTLONG LENS POLYPHEMUS The giant planet rises behind the black trees.Jake’s got a new problem He sees shapes moving with liquid grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him He is being stalked by a pack of VIPERWOLVES.Jake catches only glimpses a glint of eyes a slinking black movement then nothing Darkness.TIME CUT TIGHT ON Jake’s hands as he knots his T-shirt around the butt end of the spear.ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk Jake jams the makeshift torch into the sap soaking the shirt with it.A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing leaping shadows Jake turns warily as he moves along the trail.Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES Another pair flanking him beside the trail Black-on-black SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.He looks up sees one cross a limb overhead Another on his opposite flank Then a hideous sound like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees 36.JAKE RUNS by torch-light on the edge of panic He reaches a steep banked stream and without thinking runs across it on a horizontal trunk and STOPS DEAD on the other side The torch illuminates GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail The viperwolves have him encircled.The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each other getting excited ONE MAKES A RUN at him angling on his legs from behind but JAKE WHIRLS jamming the torch in its face It yips and goes past but ANOTHER moves in He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS retreating baring its fangs.Now half a dozen are circling him in the open and he sees what he’s up against The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with shiny chitinous skin their paws leathery BLACK HANDS Intelligent eyes Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.Jake realizes that he is making his final stand He whirls the torch in an arc keeping them at bay And feels a rush of adrenaline It goes through him like a lightning bolt and the fear is gone.JAKE(screaming)I don’t have all goddamn night! Come on! Come on! With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.Jake CRACKS the spear down on one then SPINS as ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it striking true but Its momentum wrenches it from his hands and the torch goes flying Left in semi-darkness Jake draws his KNIFE as A WOLF LUNGES sinking its teeth into his arm He YELLS in pain and fury SLASHING with the knife which CUTS deep into the beast’s shoulder and it lets go.JAKE SPRINTS trying to escape but a snarling viperwolf leaps GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand Jake tears away sprawling SCRAMBLING to get up as 37.THREE WOLVES charge at once The nearest LEAPS at his throat just as THUNK!! an ARROW appears in its chest The wolf lands on him already a dead weight He pushes it off in time to see A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees nock another arrow draw and FIRE in one fluid motion AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another wolf falls NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake and CRACKS her bow down on the skull of a circling wolf.ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight but rolls coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.Her knife FLASHES down buried to the hilt in its chest.SNARLING a wounded wolf attacks Jake and he KICKS it away but It SPINS and leaps back onto him and Jake barely catches its throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc CRACKING IT across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.NEYTIRIRrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!The wolves slink and circle yelping as the bow whistles past them Finally they break and run with Neytiri chasing and They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--NEYTIRIRaaaarrrr!Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his weight Finally it stops thrashing Panting he releases it and looks up at NEYTIRI Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest listening to the fading YELPS of the wolves Satisfied the attack is over she turns.She regards him coldly for a second then walks past him Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.JAKEWait don’t 38.Jake blinks around at the darkness realizing he can still see In fact with the blinding torchlight gone the forest is transformed.The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE spots and patterns ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light Jake scrambles to recover his spear Neytiri kneels beside A DYING WOLF It’s CRIES are pitiful It paws the air trying to raise its head She pulls her KNIFE from its chest.NEYTIRI(in Na’vi)Forgive me my brother She cuts its throat ending the pitiful cries She touches its head gently regarding it with sadness.Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her waist She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels pulling the arrow from its heart JAKELook um I know you probably don’t understand this But thanks Thank you I owe you.Neytiri ignores him assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal.NEYTIRI(in Na’vi)Forgive me May your spirit run with the Great Mother.JAKEI would have been screwed if you hadn’t come along She rises and walks away without looking at Jake JAKEHey wait Wait! Where you goin’?He crashes through some plants catching up to her.JAKESlow down a second will you I just want to thank you for killing those He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and 39.WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing laying him out flat He looks up to see a FURY standing over him A Fury who speaks English accented halting angry English.NEYTIRIDon’t thank!

They did not need to die.JAKEThey attacked me How’m I the bad guy here--She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.NEYTIRIYour fault! You are like a baby making noise don’t know what to do You should not come here all of you! You only come and make problems Only.Jake gets up slowly facing her.JAKEOkay fine you love your little forest friends So why not just let them kill my ass?

Come on! Come on! With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.Jake CRACKS the spear down on one then SPINS as ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it striking true but Its momentum wrenches it from his hands and the torch goes flying Left in semi-darkness Jake draws his KNIFE as A WOLF LUNGES sinking its teeth into his arm He YELLS in pain and fury SLASHING with the knife which CUTS deep into the beast’s shoulder and it lets go.JAKE SPRINTS trying to escape but a snarling viperwolf leaps GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand Jake tears away sprawling SCRAMBLING to get up as 37.THREE WOLVES charge at once The nearest LEAPS at his throat just as THUNK!! an ARROW appears in its chest The wolf lands on him already a dead weight He pushes it off in time to see A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees nock another arrow draw and FIRE in one fluid motion AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another wolf falls NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake and CRACKS her bow down on the skull of a circling wolf.ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight but rolls coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.Her knife FLASHES down buried to the hilt in its chest.SNARLING a wounded wolf attacks Jake and he KICKS it away but It SPINS and leaps back onto him and Jake barely catches its throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc CRACKING IT across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.NEYTIRIRrreeyaaah!

HOMETREE - BANSHEE EYRIELOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the ground.  Villagers are ant-like.  Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core trunk like a lemur.  He climbs the last section, arriving out of breath beside her.  She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like enormous umbrellas above the rainforest. NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber.  DARK SHAPES clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS.  One of the shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight. A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE.  Much larger than the forest banshees, this thing is taller than a Na’vi with a 10 meter wingspan.  A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it alights on the branch right in front of her.JAKEHoly shit.NEYTIRIDo not look in her eye.Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and gulps down.  She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the shadows nearby answer. Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the Banshee’s ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the neural connection is made.NEYTIRIIkran is not horse. Once shahaylu is made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter in the whole life. She climbs smoothly onto the animal’s back.                                     60.NEYTIRITo become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must choose your own ikran. And he must choose you.JAKEWhen?  NEYTIRIWhen you are ready.The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.NEYTIRIHeeyaaahh!Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee DROPS off the branch.  It swoops down across the forest canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a power climb.Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.  ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount, the rainforest rolling beneath her.CUT TO:INT. SHACK - NIGHT/EXTSTEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the camera.

(to camera)The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it’s like field-stripping a weapon.  Repetition.  THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri touches her lips with her fingertips.                                     61.JAKESeyri.She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence. JAKEOntu, mikyun, nari.NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he draws a longbow.BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the elbow, repositioning him roughly.JAKE (V.O.)Neytiri thinks I’m some kind of retard.  HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm’s bunk. Norm blushes and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.JAKE (V.O.)Norm’s attitude has improved lately. NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen. NORMThank you?  JAKEIreiyo.Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.NORMIrrrreiyo.  Irrrreiyo.  You’ve gotta roll the R, r-r-r-oll it.Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.JAKE (V.O.)It’s good he’s back on board, but he thinks I’m a retard too.TRACKING WITH JAKE’S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto a thick root, running on across the rough bark.JAKE (V.O.)My feet are getting tougher.  I can run farther every day.                                      62.Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are running 30 meters above the ground.  He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.  She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.JAKE (V.O.)I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri it’s learn fast or die.Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its DROOP to slow her fall.  She lets go, plummeting, and catches another. JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith.  THE CAMERA PLUNGES with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush.He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a game trail.  He is exhilarated to still be alive. Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.  That he lived.TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack.  Thinking as he looks at the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO’AT.  The  Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.  Grace’s eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na’vi.   JAKE (V.O.)I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass.  Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning.Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching.  It is an awkward moment between them.  Grace makes the formal gesture of greeting.GRACE(Na’vi, subtitled)I See you, Neytiri Mo’at’ite.NEYTIRII See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out the tracks in the mud to Jake.  She touches the edges of the plants around her, and sniffs the air.                                     63.JAKE (V.O.)I’m learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds.JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes flight, an explosion of purple wings. Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her ears, which move with a life of their own.  Her eyes are closed.  She speaks very softly to Jake --NEYTIRIWhen you hear nothing, you will hear everything.  When you see nothing, you will See everything.JAKE (V.O.)Sometimes I have no idea what she’s talking about. Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male HEXAPEDE --  a six legged deer-like creature.Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri watches.  He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm.  Zen archery.JAKE (V.O.)It’s been a month and I’m still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasn’t given permission.OMIITEDNEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.  She points and he parts some leaves to see --A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk around her legs.  She licks their faces.JAKE (V.O.)There’s a lot of crap like that. She’s always going on about the flow of energy-- the spirits of the animals and what not --                                      64.VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.  He’s changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow.  Pale. JAKE(smirking)I just hope this treehugger shit isn’t on the final.Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples.  GRACE(without looking up)This isn’t just about eye-hand coordination out there.  You need to listen to what she says.  Try to see the forest through their eyes.JAKEExcuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay?NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence.  They move gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.  NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom of a pool.  A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.  ZAP!  Jake drills it.  He holds up the fish, triumphantly.ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders. Aware of her touch, Jake’s focus is broken.  Their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly.NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.  Neytiri signals him to move slowly.  They approach a creature on one of the ferns.  An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING perched on a frond.  As he approaches --SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee. THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.                                      65.Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY.  An EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.  Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until they are all flying.  And for the first time, she is unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake’s eyes open in the darkness.  He doesn’t know where he is.  He weakly pushes open the lid, blinking at the light.JAKE (V.O.)Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes focused in intense concentration.  A beat -- the arrow flies.JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede. He dispatches it with his knife.He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na’vi.JAKE(Na’vi)I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People. NEYTIRI watches with approval.  NEYTIRIA clean kill.  You are ready.CUT TO:INT. SHACK - NIGHTLying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin.  Norm helps Grace get him to his chair.GRACEYou’re still losing weight.  Here -- She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien food.  Bites into it without enthusiasm.JAKEI made a kill today.  We ate it.  I know where that meal came from.                                     66.GRACE Other body.  You need to take care of this body.JAKEYeah yeah.GRACEJake, I’m serious -- you look like crap. You’re burning too hard. Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out.JAKEGet rid of this shit, then you can lecture me.GRACEI’m telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time.JAKENot now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya. GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee.GRACEYeah -- you’re gonna go ride a banshee.  Or die trying.  JAKEThat’s right, Grace. This is what I’ve been working for.GRACEAnd this is your check up from the neck up, Marine.  You’re getting in way too deep. (she turns away)Trust me, I learned the hard way.Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace’s workstation.JAKEWhat did happen at the school?GRACE looks up from making coffee.  Her eyes track across the pictures of the laughing children.  Finally --                                      67.GRACENeytiri’s sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped coming to school.  She was angry about the clear-cutting.GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste. GRACEOne day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up -- they’d set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess they thought I could protect them. GRACE’S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator.GRACEThe troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse. MACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING. GRACEThey killed Sylwanin in the doorway.  Right in front of Neytiri.  Then shot the others.(mildly)I got most of the kids out, before they shot me.JAKEJesus. GRACEYeah. Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it.GRACEA scientist stays objective -- we can not be ruled by emotion.  But I poured ten years of my life into that school. They called me sa’atenuk. Mother. (turning to him)That kind of pain reaches back through the link.  GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake. GRACEIt’s a job.  Learn what you can -- but don’t get attached.                                     68.GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes.GRACEIt’s not our world, Jake.  And we can’t stop what’s coming.  CUT TO:EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAYTSU’TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who’s riding well enough to keep up. The horses’ hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a misty canyon.  JAKE (V.O.)Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven.  It’s the test every young hunter has to pass.TSU’TEY signals a stop.UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation.  Thick vine-like trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in their gnarled grip.   A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the twisted vine-trunks.  This is some sort of freak natural occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the clouds.There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and the ground SHAKES.  Jake looks around at --One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa.  A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is drifting toward them, filling half the sky.The Hunters dismount. JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He turns to Tsu’tey, who is checking the young hunters’ gear.JAKEWe doin’ this?Jake leaps to catch up as Tsu’tey and the hunters swarm up the base of the beanstalk.CUT TO:                                     69.EXT. BEANSTALK - DAY200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along the vine-trunks.  They clamber over one of the unobtanium BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it -- it floats upward.They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them, the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms.  Spray from one of the waterfalls hits them.Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.  Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling over nothingness.  They climb toward the floating islands above. EXT.

The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest He touches the feathers of the ancient weapon then with an ironic laugh he dies.NEYTIRI runs up another arrow nocked bow drawn Seeing Quaritch she lowers her father’s bow.JAKE sees her then goes limp his eyes rolling back and INT SHACKHUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link slamming to the floor where he gags for breath With his last strength he claws toward an emergency breathing mask across the room.He scrambles toward it on the edge of unconsciousness.NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window landing in the debris like a cat She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake’s side puts the mask over his face and 147.JAKE drags in breath after breath He looks up at Neytiri studying him as she holds him seeing his human body for the first time.Jake touches her face his pale human hand against the blue of her skin There eyes meet across the glass of the mask together separate Worldless.CUT TO:EXT RAINFOREST DAYMO’AT tends to the mortally wounded TSU’TEY as AVATAR JAKE arrives with Neytiri Mo’at has bound his wounds but by her expression it is clear he cannot be saved.Jake kneels and Tsu’tey opens his eyes Through a haze of pain he recognizes Jake.TSU’TEY(Na’vi)I See you Jakesully.JAKEI See you Tsu’tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.TSU’TEYAre the people safe?JAKEThey’re safe.Tsu’tey weakly clutches his severed queue.TSU’TEYI can never ride again or bond with my woman or hear the voice of Eywa I can not lead the People You will lead them Jakesully.JAKENo I’m not officer material.TSU’TEYIt is decided Now do the duty of Olo’eyctan Set my spirit free.JAKEI’m not killing you.TSU’TEYI am already dead 148.JAKENo.TSU’TEYIt is the way And it is good I will be remembered Tsu’tey’s voice is weak but thick with emotion.TSU’TEY I fought with Toruk Macto we were brothers and he was my last shadow.TSU’TEY’S HAND clasps with Jake’s in a fierce grip Jake draws his knife.TSU’TEY’S POV Jake leans forward blocking the sun HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu’tey JAKE(Na’vi)Forgive me my Brother Go now to the Mother Spirit.By his movement we know that he has ended Tsu’tey’s pain Jake’s eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the prayer for the dead and his Na’vi words carry over as we DISSOLVE TO:EXT HELL’S GATE DAYNa’vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell’s Gate Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules and stingbats flutter about unimpeded The SENTRY GUNS are silent and the GATES are open to the forest.JAKE (V.O.)A few chose to stay Fewer were chosen Max Norm and a few of the avatars hold AR’s as the personnel of Hell’s Gate file up the cargo ramp of the remaining shuttle The evicted humans are sullen and angry like POW’s JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together watching the departure of the Sky People PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp His eyes the eyes of a lost soul meet JAKE’S He disappears into the ship.CUT TO: 149.EXT SPACEISV VENTURE STAR hangs suspended against the dark side of PANDORA The ISV’s antimatter engines BLAZE to life and it accelerates out of orbit.What remains IN FRAME is a virgin primeval world Spanning the black continents is a vast reticulated lace-work of BIOLUMINESCENCE a ghostly WEB connecting all of Pandora.CUT TO:EXT RAINFOREST DAYThe sun’s rays shaft down through the layers of canopy.JAKE (V.O.)The forest will heal and so will the hearts of the People New life keeps the energy flowing like the breath of the world NEYTIRI obviously pregnant is bow-fishing in the shallows Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river JAKE (V.O.)This is my last videolog INT LINK ROOMVIDEO IMAGE Jake sits in a chair talking straight TO CAMERA He is thin pale He looks around the high tech room.JAKEThe science guys will keep the lights on here But I won’t miss this place EXT WELL OF SOULS NIGHTTHE WILLOWS glow softly The entire Omaticaya clan is gathered seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree.JAKE (V.O.)I better wrap this up There’s a funeral tonight and I don’t want to be late It was someone very close to me.WIDE SHOT moving in across the concentric rings of people all plugged-in and softly chanting MOVING toward the center over the figure of Mo'at to hover above NEYTIRI kneeling beside two FIGURES on the dais 150.JAKE and his AVATAR lie head to head Human Jake is wearing an exomask Both figures are still hands folded covered in translucent silken shrouds of ROOT-CILIA CAMERA CLOSES IN as Neytiri removes the mask from Jake's human face She gently closes his dead eyes with her fingertips Then bends and kisses him MOVE INTO CU on AVATAR JAKE as Neytiri’s hand comes into frame stroking his cheek TIGHTENING slowly to--ECU JAKE’S EYES Hold a beat then They open.CUT TO BLACK 151\"}}}]"
