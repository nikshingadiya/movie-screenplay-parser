That sonuvabitch is down!\\nINT. CONN-POD ZUMA-1 -- DUSKWe’re tight on a young man’s face -- his square jaw tense; \\nhis short, dirty blond hair damp with sweat; his eyes focused and urgent. He’s RALEIGH ANTROBUS (23), a rare sort of pilot.\\nWe don\\'t see much. It feels dark, cramped, and busy. Perhaps \\na cockpit. We\\'re dimly aware of Raleigh\\'s view reflected on the glass visor of his helmet -- a flat, blue horizon.\\nRALEIGH\\nStand by for confirmation...\\nVOICE (FILTERED)\\nRals! We got him! Nothing gets up from a hit like that!\\nRaleigh\\'s tension starts to ease, but just as a smile of relief begins to creep across his lips, we see something move in the reflection on his helmet --\\nA shape; distorted, out of focus, monstrous, vast... Alive. \\nChilling in its size and obscurity as it rises to darken the reflection. We hear a bone-shuddering ROAR.\\nRaleigh\\'s smile melts away. His game-face quickly takes hold.\\nRALEIGH\\nLook sharp, Yance! He’s getting up!\\nINT. COUNSELOR’S OFFICE -- DAYRaleigh wakes on the couch (a year older). He unplugs a wire \\nfrom a port behind his ear and quickly sits up.\\nHis COUNSELOR, a calm man in uniform, unplugs his own wire, \\ndisconnecting from the Pons brain-to-brain server.\\nRaleigh perches anxiously on the edge of the couch. The \\nCounselor gives him a second. Raleigh scratches the data port discreetly embedded in the flesh behind his ear lobe.\\nRALEIGH\\nI need to get this damn thing taken out. I’m not a driver any more.\\n(CONTINUED)COUNSELOR\\nI know you’ve had a rough go at it \\nso far, but the port can actually be useful in therapy --\\nRALEIGH\\nSharing headspace with my own brother was crowded enough. I don’t wanna make room for anyone else.\\nCOUNSELOR\\nAlright. We can do it the old fashioned way. Talk it out...\\nRALEIGH\\nNo. Listen. I don’t want to relive that day. Okay? I want to bury it.\\nCOUNSELOR\\nBut you can\\'t avoid the triggers. This is the world we live in now. \\nRaleigh stands up to leave. The Counselor catches him, putting a hand on his shoulder and confiding earnestly.\\nCOUNSELOR (CONT’D)\\nThis is a dagger in your heart, man. The deeper you bury it, the harder it hurts. You’ll feel it every time you hear about another attack and you won’t know why...\\nRALEIGH\\nI can tell you why -- because I’m helpless. And nothing you can say will ever change that...\\nINT. LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS\\nRaleigh passes the reception area on the way out. A handful \\nof uniformed PERSONNEL are glued to the news on a wall-mounted tv. Raleigh stops. He can’t help himself.\\nOn the news, we see shots of toppled buildings, upturned \\ncars, and splintered Japanese billboards. The label at the bottom of the screen tells us it’s Tokyo.\\nCNN ANCHOR (FILTERED)\\n-- the second attack in four months, up from last year --\\n(beat)\\nJust a moment...2.\\nCONTINUED:\\n(CONTINUED)In the chaotic rubble, we pull back from a \"hill\" that turns \\nout to be the flank of some vast carcass, entrails spilled \\nacross the fractured streets like sagging hot air balloons. \\nWe see also the wreck of a heavily-armored, human-shaped mech \\n-- a Jaeger. MEN drag the distraught GUNNER from the wreck, a young Asian girl in a form-fitting drivesuit (more later).\\nCNN ANCHOR (FILTERED) (CONT’D)\\nWe\\'re seeing the gunner now. And officials are confirming that tragically her crewmate, pilot Aki Seto, has died in the attack.\\nRaleigh shakes himself from the grim news and promptly exits.\\nEXT. SHINAGAWA -- NIGHT\\nA cluster of tents amidst heaps of rubble. The wrecked Jaeger \\nand kaiju carcass still looms in the background. Helicopters circle overhead, throwing light down on the mess.\\nSUPER: Shinagawa Incident Zone -- Tokyo, Japan\\nINT. MEDICAL TENT -- CONTINUOUSThe improvised field hospital swarms with DOCTORS treating \\nthe CASUALTIES of the attack.\\nThe gunner from the news footage, MAKO MORI (22), sits \\ncatatonic, her arm in a sling. Her hair hugs her face in a \\nhelmet-like Chinese bob. She has firm and quiet bearing.\\nA man in uniform spots her. STACKER PENTECOST, a black Briton \\nwith a face that is at all times the very picture of \\nconfident serenity. He tries to get her attention.\\n(NOTE: Hereafter, italicized dialogue indicates \"spoken \\nJapanese with English subtitles.\" )\\nPENTECOST\\nLieutenant Mori... Lieutenant... Lieutenant... Mako...\\nFinally, she looks up.\\nPENTECOST (CONT’D)\\nThey\\'ve cleared you to go.\\nMAKO\\nHow\\'s the Jaeger?\\nPENTECOST\\nThe core\\'s fried. \\nHe takes a seat beside her.3.\\nCONTINUED:\\n(CONTINUED)PENTECOST (CONT’D)\\nAki was a hero, Mako. He saved the \\ncity. He saved your life.\\nShe doesn\\'t react.\\nPENTECOST (CONT’D)\\nYou can go now. You know that, \\nright? You don\\'t have to stay.\\nSlowly, she turns to him.\\nMAKO\\nWhere can I go? My Jaeger is \\nbroken. My winger is gone. What am I now? Who am I?\\nEXT. JAEGER-MEISTER’S BAR & GRILL -- NIGHT\\nA dive bar fronting a small, gravel parking lot off a dark \\nseaside highway -- an island of neon in the night.\\nSUPER: Jaeger-Meister\\'s Bar & Grill -- Port Hueneme, \\nCalifornia\\nFLICK (PRE-LAP)\\nSo does our source have a name?\\nINT. COMPACT CAR -- CONTINUOUS\\nThe dive’s neon sign casts a lurid glow on the windshield.In the driver’s seat, FELICITY \"FLICK\" KINCAID. A clever girl \\nin faded denim and paisley cotton, a canyon bohemian flavor. She tucks her rambunctious blonde curls behind her ear.\\nA series of brief, cryptic emails, fanned out in the \\npassenger seat. She speaks to her IT guy (JIM) through a bluetooth headset as she takes notes.\\nJIM (FILTERED)\\nI couldn’t crack the remailer, but I pinged the dropbox and got a hit. It’s a cpo.org server.\\nFLICK\\nCPO -- ?\\nShe scribbles notes, glancing up at the PATRONS leaving the bar, most in standard-issue jumpsuits from the nearby Jaeger base. She’s expecting someone.\\nJIM (FILTERED)\\nCalixto Particle Observatory. Peru. Just outside of Lima.4.\\nCONTINUED:\\n(CONTINUED)FLICK\\nYeah? What do they observe?\\nJIM (FILTERED)\\nQuarks, bosons, tachyons -- you \\nknow, stuff no one’s heard of.\\nFLICK\\nSo our guy’s a particle physicist.\\nJIM (FILTERED)\\nYou’re not going to Peru, right?\\nAlready, she’s surfing her smartphone for airplane tickets.\\nFLICK\\nNot as far as you know.\\nJIM (FILTERED)\\nI’m lying to your editor again?\\nFLICK\\nHe won’t understand.\\nJIM (FILTERED)\\nThat your leaving the country instead of emailing the guy?\\nFLICK\\nI send him questions. His replies are vague and infrequent. If he’s got the answers he claims to have, I need to meet him.\\nJIM (FILTERED)\\nYou don’t know how solid he is.\\nFLICK\\nI will when I shake his hand.\\nJIM (FILTERED)\\nYou’ll spook the hell out of him. He wants to be anonymous.\\nFLICK\\nIt’s not me he’s scared of. If it is, he’s screwing with me.\\nShe spots Raleigh staggering out of the bar and quickly wraps up her conversation.\\nFLICK (CONT’D)\\nI have to go. Thanks, Jim. I owe you one.5.\\nCONTINUED:\\n(CONTINUED)She grabs her stack of e-mails and gets out of the car.\\nEXT. JAEGER-MEISTER’S BAR & GRILL -- CONTINUOUSFlick chases after Raleigh.\\nFLICK\\nRaleigh.\\nHe spots her, and keeps walking, indifferent. She follows.\\nFLICK (CONT’D)\\nI’ve been trying to get a hold of \\nyou. Ever check your messages?\\nRALEIGH\\nI’m not going on the record, Flick.\\nFLICK\\nI’m not looking for an interview.\\nRALEIGH\\nOh? You’re not? You’ve finally given up that tired dead end story?\\nFLICK\\n(defensive)\\nThere’s a region off Midway that’s been spitting out giant monsters for over a decade. How can it still be such a goddamned mystery? --\\nRALEIGH\\nI dunno, but the ocean floor is like five miles deep out there. It’s not the easiest place to know.\\nFLICK\\nSo COSDEC’s just clueless?\\nRALEIGH\\nProbably not, but it’s all rumors by the time it gets to us jocks.\\nHe gets to his car and unlocks the door. Flick drops her ace.\\nFLICK\\nDo they call it the Interstice?\\nHe stops -- they obviously do.\\nFLICK (CONT’D)\\nYance let that word slip every once in a while. 6.\\nCONTINUED: (2)\\n(MORE)\\n(CONTINUED)I didn’t even remember until I got \\nthis anonymous email: \\n(reading)\\n“They know what the Interstice is.”\\nRALEIGH\\nWe shouldn’t be talking about this.\\nFLICK\\nWhat is the Interstice?\\nRALEIGH\\nI thought this wasn’t an interview.\\nShe relents; she knows why she really hunted him down.\\nFLICK\\nIt’s not. I’m just -- Jesus, it\\'s been like a year since we\\'ve talked at all... I was his fiancée. We\\'re like family. Friends at least...\\nRALEIGH\\nExes?\\nFLICK\\nEx-what? I was never sure...\\n(no answer)\\nYou ever have a nightmare too awful to talk about, Rals? \\nHe ignores the question.\\nFLICK (CONT’D)\\nI saw how close you and your brother were. I did a piece about it. What you and me had, it felt so -- small. I never thought you cared enough to miss it... Yance said you were cool with me and him.\\nRALEIGH\\nIf Yance said it...\\nFLICK\\nBut \\nyou never did. You never said \\nanything. You just avoided us...And I wonder if he\\'d be alive if not for me. I wonder if I screwed up the bond that drove the machine.\\nRALEIGH\\nGoddamn, Flick. Today of all days.7.\\nCONTINUED:\\nFLICK (CONT’D)\\n(CONTINUED)FLICK\\nSorry, but I\\'ve been living with --\\nRALEIGH\\nHe was my brother, Flick! \\nFLICK\\nIt\\'s my nightmare! Okay? And when I \\nwake up screaming...\\n(trailing off)\\nYou won\\'t call me back, Raleigh...\\nShe closes her eyes and pinches the bridge of her nose, \\nembarrassed, collecting herself. She can\\'t meet his eyes.\\nRALEIGH\\nYou know how the Pons works? Two Jaeger pilots driving the rig with their brains, all those thoughts bleeding between them... Every time me and Yancy plugged in, I had a front row seat. All those intimate moments. I\\'ve walked in on you two more times than you even know. It was torture driving that Jaeger with him. Just torture. \\nFlick stares at him, frozen, tears welling up in her eyes.\\nRALEIGH (CONT’D)\\nSo you want me to tell you none of that colored my judgment; that I put it aside and did all I could?\\n(pausing to reflect)\\nWell, I\\'m sorry Flick, but I dunno... Probably not.\\nTears spill from her eyes. She can find no words. Finally, she SLAPS him as hard as she can.\\nHe watches her storm back to her car. She throttles it out of \\nthe gravelly lot, ripping plumes of dust in her taillights.\\nINT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\\nRaleigh staggers into his small mobile home. \\nINT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUSRaleigh splashes water on his face and meets his reflection \\nin the small mirror, fractured as if by bare knuckles some \\nfitful night not so long ago.\\nHe steels his cold expression and nods slowly -- Yes, this is \\nwho you are, Raleigh.8.\\nCONTINUED: (2)\\n(CONTINUED)His brow cracks and he collapses over the toilet puking up \\nevery shred of the stony facade he\\'s been holding, revealing \\nthe raw anguish and self-doubt, red-faced and heaving.\\nThrough his GASPING he almost doesn\\'t hear the KNOCKING at \\nhis front door...\\nINT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS\\nRaleigh takes a deep breath before he opens the door to find \\na uniformed military officer on his doorstep, LIEUTENANT-\\nCOMMANDER ROSCOE CALHOUN. He gives Raleigh a familiar grin.\\nCALHOUN\\nHey, Raleigh... Got a minute?\\nEXT. RALEIGH\\'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\\nThe mobile home overlooks the seaside strawberry fields off a \\ndark stretch of the PCH. Raleigh sits on the tailgate of his \\nold pickup as Calhoun smokes his cigarette.\\nIn the distance, the Point Mugu Air Station, where the \\nsilhouettes of the LA Strike Group\\'s two Jaegers tower in the \\nocean fog, waiting, red caution lights blinking placidly.\\nCALHOUN\\nTokyo\\'s down one Jaeger. It\\'s the biggest city on the Rim. It\\'s \\nCOSDEC headquarters. The brass wants redundancy. They want a crew \\ncovering that second Jaeger.\\nRALEIGH\\nAnd you think I know somebody?\\nCalhoun knows Raleigh sees it coming, so he gets to it.\\nCALHOUN\\nThey just need some understudies, at least until the rooks graduate \\nthis summer. A few months tops. You\\'ll go to Tokyo all expenses \\npaid, you\\'ll eat some sushi, and \\nyou\\'ll be back in time for June gloom. It\\'s a cushy gig.\\nRALEIGH\\nThe attacks are coming faster --\\nCALHOUN\\nThere\\'s no evidence of long-term --\\nRALEIGH\\nYou don\\'t shoehorn two burnt-out \\nleftovers into a Pons and call it a \\nJaeger crew if you\\'re not expecting some new kind of trouble.9.\\nCONTINUED:\\n(CONTINUED)CALHOUN\\n(leveling with Raleigh)\\nWe don\\'t know what to expect... \\nLook, you lost your winger and the weight of the whole damn city fell on your shoulders; and for seventy-seven seconds you carried it, and you finished the fight.\\nA silence passes as Raleigh reflects on the proposition.\\nRALEIGH\\nWho\\'s your other sucker?\\nCALHOUN\\nAnother survivor...\\nRALEIGH\\nNot the girl from the news?\\nCALHOUN\\nName\\'s Mako Mori. She\\'s a little \\nthing, but she\\'s tough as nails.\\nRALEIGH\\nI\\'m a mess and lost Yance over a year ago. She lost hers today...\\nCALHOUN\\n(sighing, a surrender)\\nHell, I dunno. I\\'ve never tried on \\nthat skyscraper suit.\\nThey stare out towards the two distant Jaegers, looming like \\nindustrial colossuses in the silver murk of the marine layer. \\nCALHOUN (CONT’D)\\nYou know, I always wanted to ask -- What\\'s it feel like?\\nRaleigh turns to him, brow furrowed, not sure if he\\'s \\nserious. He is. Raleigh turns and stares at the Jaeger\\'s silhouette for a while before answering.\\nRALEIGH\\nThere’s things you just can’t fight. Acts of God or whatever.

A year to us might be just an hour to them. So there\\'s no objective time within the Interstice. Which rules out any remote detonation. Our timeframe wouldn\\'t agree with the bomb\\'s timeframe.
